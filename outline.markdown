#Concept of Flat Design

##Type as a Construct

Intersection of type design and industrial design; how usability of type informs 
usability of the product.

##"Gestalt" versus "Global" Views

A Product as a View.

##The Paradox of the Prototype

Talk of "adding N prototypes."

##Advent of the Temporal Hierarchy (Tomorrow is the Question!)

Talk of the Time Series as it relates to a transvaluation (rather than a reconfiguration) 
of our concept of the "visual hierarchy."

Must needs be informed by "Metaphors We Live By".

##Perspectival Grid Systems as a Sui Generis Departure

Talk of the "end of the grid" and all metaphors parasitic on classical concepts of design; 
and of the "end" of the Structure-Stricture paradox which historically determined all forms 
traditional design.

Talk of the "end of technodesign"; end of the "camera as the picture" metanarrative of design.

##Modular Books

Talk of the Being of books ("Book is book.") and the true beginning of reproducibility; and 
the end of "knowledge" as dependent on the expression of "justified true belief" under the 
classsical.

Talk of Type as a versioning system for history itself.

Talk of the beginning of "comaccessibility" (a play on Leibniz's "compossibility"; but which 
expands to "communicative accessibility," the creative endeavor of discovery of interaction 
models within Restricted Senses Spaces. Say, UI hooks for blind users over; UI hook schemas 
for hearing impaired, various modalities of learning impairment (knowledge rate increase 
conforms to a game theory standard of expansion or contraction for each individual through 
the usability possibilities of books qua books).

"The Book is a Multiple"; thus, the Book is not. The historical disruptions of dyslexias 
and aphasias.

Scripture as a recursive evidence of the First modular book.

First Ancestor or Prototype of "holographic books" (Glass Books, Light Books).

##What's in an Icon?

Icons and Idols are the same fucking thing, Ernst and Neurath.

This book uses "curse-words"; cursing words as opposed to "safe words" (shibboleths).

Cognitive load as a framework for predicting confirmation biases; confirmation biases 
as a predictor of literacy, dependency, etc.

##Post-history

Talk of the end of Foucaultian meta-binaries between description and prescription; the end 
of "glue historian" who adapts Reality and History, Logos and Ethos, Matriarchal society and 
Patriarchal Society.

##Typality

The Interpretational Stance as applied to typography: The amorous, the political, the 
scientifc, the aesthetic conditions of type. So, type as a romantic actor, type as a political 
agent, type as an objective vessel, and type as a designer. Thus, Type itself as the archetype 
designer through the Subject (designers as militants of design). A Popperian re-interpretation 
of the epistemic backdrop of typography.
